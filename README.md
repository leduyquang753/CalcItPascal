# CalcIt Pascal
A simple to use calculator, written in Pascal.

## Introduction
*“Written in Pascal”*. Reading this, you are probably imagining a rather old, obsolete programming language that can only be used in schools and run in a dull, ugly command-line console like back in the 90s. If that is really what is in your mind right now, then you will have to think again. Thanks to the [Free Pascal Compiler](https://freepascal.org) and [Lazarus](https://lazarus-ide.org), this is a GUI application, with windows:

This program takes any simple to medium level mathematical expressions and evaluate them. You can use the program to calculate stuff in your daily life, at school, or anywhere else you like.

### Features
- Simple GUI.
- Evaluates expressions with respect to mathematical precedence.
- Many mathematical functions available.
- Variables system with arbitrary variable names.

## Usage
### General
The program’s main window is where you enter your mathematical expressions into the *Input* box to be evaluated, either by clicking the *Calculate* button or hitting Enter. The program will (try to) evaluate and output its response to the *Console*. The *Console* retains all calculations performed during a session of the program.

Any spaces in the expression will be ignored and everything is case-insensitive. You can use pipe characters to separate multiple expressions to calculate at a time.

Clicking the *Variables* button will bring up a window to watch variables:

![CalcIt Pascal variables dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leduyquang753/leduyquang753.github.io/master/CalcItPascal-variables.png)
 
It displays the value of A to Z, PreAns, Ans and a custom one of your choice. Clicking a variable name button will insert the name into *Input*.

Clicking *Settings* allows you to tweak the program's behavior:

Anything there is pretty straightforward to understand, so detailed documentation isn't needed here, except some notes:
- Setting *Maximum expressions stored* to a different value will clear the expression history.
- *Startup expressions* box can have comments after double slashes on each line and doesn't allow pipe characters to separate expressions.

### Calculator behavior and syntax
#### Basics
An expression has two parts: variable assignment (optional) and the main expression to be evaluated.
- Variable assignment comprises of a variable name followed by an equal sign (=). Multiple variable assignments can be chained in the same expression.
- The main expression can contain numbers, variables, operators and functions.

*Examples:*
`16,3+27,5.3-3^2sin(45)` will evaluate to 90,7928932188.
`tables=racks=50:5` will evaluate to 10 and assign it to variables named `tables` and `racks`.

#### Numbers
A number entered into the program must follow these requirements:
- Uses a dot or comma to separate the integral and fractional part, cannot have more than one dot/comma.
- Can have thousand separators (dots, commas or spaces depending on the settings) between digits but not at the beginning.
- Can have negative (-) or positive (+) signs at the beginning. Note: The precedence of the negative and positive signs depends on the expression, see [Calculation order](#calculation-order).
- Can use a percent sign (%) at the end to divide the number by 100, cannot have more than one percent sign.

#### Variables
A variable stores a number which can be used inside an expression. Each variable is identified by a name that must follow these requirements:
- Can only contain a÷z, 0÷9 and underscore (_) characters.
- Cannot start with a digit.

#### Operands
An operand is placed between two numbers/variables to perform a mathematical operation on the numbers.

The program currently supports these operands:

\+	Addition

\-	Subtraction

. \*	Multiplication

: /	Division

^	Exponentiation

\#	Root

#### Braces and functions
A section of the expression can be grouped by surrounding with one of these character pairs: () [] \{\} <>, in which case the grouped expression is called a bracelet. The expression inside will be calculated first before its result is used for evaluation of the greater expression part. If an identifier (similar to a variable name) is placed right before the opening brace, the bracelet will become a function. A function will take the expression inside the bracelet as their arguments and evaluate to a number. A function can have multiple arguments, in which case the arguments are separated by semicolons (;).

Negative and positive signs can also be placed before a bracelet.

*Notes:*
- If there are more than one parameter inside a bracelet that is not a function, the bracelet will evaluate to the sum of the parameters.
- If a bracelet is empty, it will evaluate to 0. Similarly, if a parameter is empty, it will be treated as 0. The consequence is a function can never have 0 parameters.
- The precedence of the negative and positive signs depends on the expression, see [Calculation order](#calculation-order).

For a list of functions and how they should be used, refer to the [List of functions](#list-of-functions).

#### Multiplication without sign
In some places, the multiplication sign can be omitted in the expression, in which case the multiplication’s precedence will be raised higher than normal multiplication and division (see Calculation order). The places where the multiplication sign can be omitted are:

- Between a number before and a variable after, example: `13pi`.
- Between a number before and a bracelet after, example: `13(3+5)`.
- Between a bracelet before and a number/variable after, examples: `(3+5)13`; `(2,5+16,8)pi`.
- Between two bracelets, example: `(2+3)(4+5)`.

#### Calculation order
The program evaluates the expression with respect to mathematical precedence, as follows:

Order|Things that are evaluated
-----|-----
\#1 First|Bracelets
\#2 Second|Exponentiation (calculation order: right to left)
\#3 Third|Root (calculation order: left to right)
\#4 Fourth|Multiplication without sign (calculation order: left to right)
\#5 Fifth|Multiplication with sign, division (calculation order: left to right)
\#6 Sixth|Addition, subtraction (calculation order: left to right)

The negative/positive signs’ precedence is a bit special: it’s higher than operators before and lower than operators with higher precedence than multiplication, for example `2^-2` will calculate `-2` first before performing the exponentiation, while `-2^2` will perform 2^2 = 4 before the result gets negated.

### Output
If the expression is valid, after evaluating the full expression, the program will print to the console an equal sign (=) followed by the evaluated number, clearing the Input box. Otherwise, it will print `ERROR:` and explain what was wrong with the expression, the expression will be retained in the box. In some cases, the Input box’s caret will move to the erroneous place in the expression.

#### Special use cases
You can exploit the program’s abilities to do some awesome things. Here lists a few of them:

##### Convert units
For example you can calculate how many seconds is 17h01:25 through the use of variables and bracelets:

```
hours=hour=3600
= 3 600

minutes=minute=60
= 60

seconds=second=1
= 1

(17 hours; 1 minute; 25 seconds)
= 61 285
```

##### Calculating a simple series
For example the Fibonacci sequence can be computed as follows:

```
1
= 1

1
= 1

Ans+PreAns
= 2

Ans+PreAns // Repeatedly pressing Enter will repeatedly calculate the same expression.
= 3

Ans+PreAns
= 5

Ans+PreAns
= 8

Ans+PreAns
= 13
```
