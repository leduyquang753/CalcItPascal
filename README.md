# CalcIt

This is a port of the Java library [CalcIt](https://github.com/leduyquang753/CalcIt) written in Object Pascal in Lazarus. Porting it shows these advantages:

- There is a nice GUI instead of a boring console.
- No need to install a JRE for the program to run.

If you want this port as a library, just get the source files **ucalculatorengine.pas** and **uexpressioninvalidexception.pas**. The first one is the core of the program.
